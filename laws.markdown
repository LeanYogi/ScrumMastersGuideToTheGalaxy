Laws you should know
====================

#Conways law

#Brooks law
* Brook's Law says basically adding more people to complete a late project that is failing will not work due to the cost of time do to hiring, training, etc... 
* But David Anderson, the Kanban Guru, suggests that is more an issue for methods like waterfall, where you don't start developing until almost half way or more thru the project timeline because busy trying make "perfect requirements".  This means you won't know your in trouble until it is too late. If your using agile process like Kanban or Scrum, where not waiting to start project until everything is defined and starting getting feedback asap, it is possible to identify early on that project needs more folks and sucessfully scale up.
