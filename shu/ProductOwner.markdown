##Overview
###A product owner is responsible for:  
*Prioritization of the backlog  
*Defines product features  
*Can change prioirity and features every sprint  
*Accepts or rejects sprint work results  
*Is responsibile for profitablity of the product (this one is tough in a large org. as this is often a senior manager)  

##Product Vision
###A product owner should have a direct line and control of the product vision.  This is more of a longer term vision (6-24 months).  It is useful for the teams to understand this vision as it will help to understand the product as it is now and where it is going.  It gives the product team context in terms of backlog items and prioritization

##Sprint Goals
###The product owner should set and communicate sprint goals to the team at the beginning of each sprint, preferably during sprint planning
####Sprint goals should emphasize the business drivers and business value. (should not be a list of pbis to be included in the sprint).  ####Sprint goals will help the feature teams understand the prioritization of the PBIs during the sprint, the value that the completion of the PBIs (as a whole) will bring to the product.  It will also help the feature teams understand the negative impact that incomplete PBIs to the business.

##Roadmapping
###The product owner should ultimately drive the roadmapping session with the feature team members.  
####If the P.O. has questions about a PBI in terms of contents, functionality, cross impacts then the P.O. should directly ask the feature team members for detail.  
###Roadmapping will help the product owner understand what pieces (PBI's) will be needed to meet sprint goals, and also how many sprints it will take to have the complete vision accomplished.
###Mapping PBI's 3-4 sprints out will help the product owner and team with prioritization by showing impacts of moving PBIs up or back a sprint. 
###As always, agile planning will be less accurate the farther in the future you go.
