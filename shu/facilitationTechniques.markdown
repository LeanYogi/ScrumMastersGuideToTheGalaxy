#Facilitation techniques
**The main thing with facilitating is getting folks to use some sort visual display - whiteboard, flip chart, electronic whiteboard, etc... -  This will greatly help improve discussions and understanding**

##Decider protocal

**First Step - Decide if require unanimous (99% should not) or majority -make sure define majority, >1/2 >2/3 (for more important decisions), etc...**

1. Roman Vote - Most common protocal, Thumb Up = Agree, Thumb Down = Disagree and Thumb Sideway = Indifferent. Can change meanings to actual choices if only 2 or 3 items to chose between, ie Up = Just a Hamburger, Side = Just Fries and Down = Burger and Fries. Can also change meaning slightly: Up = Agree, Side = Will support majority, Down = Want to discuss

2. Fist of Five
 * 0 fingers (a fist): No way, terrible choice, I will not go along with it. A way to block consensus.
 * 1 finger: I have serious reservations with this idea, but I vote to move forward, but I’d prefer to resolve the concerns before supporting it.
 * 2 fingers: I have some concerns, but I’ll go along and try it.
 * 3 fingers: I will support the idea.
 * 4 fingers: I like this idea, sounds good.
 * 5 fingers: Absolutely, best idea ever! I’ll champion it.

##Dot Voting
This a way to have group priortize or pick a topic from list of choices quickly.

1. Make a list on white board or large post-it tablet (could use excel or word or similar software if desperate)
2. Based on the number items, make a judgement call on how many dots (votes) each person gets, usually 3 or 4 if prioritzing. This allows people more freedom then just choosing one vote and reduces decision times.
3. Folks then place a dot using a marker next to each topic they are interested in or feel is important. A person can place all or multiple dots on one item if they choose.
4. Once all folks have placed dots, the topic with most dots is the top priority or winner. Priorty of other items then can judge based decreasing number dots each gets.

Uses:

1. Retrospective - have a team list out topics they would like to discuss and then use dot voting to choose which ones to tackle first in the retro
2. Product Backlog Refinement - Not probably used as final solution to priortizing a back log since value and other more important things should drive final descisions, but can be used help weed out low priorty items if got large backlog to look at.
3. Really any other meeting where got limited time and need to prioritize topics

##Don't be a time box nazi
Time boxing is important way to keep meetings moving, but don't just shout out "Stop" - warn the team when time is approaching and watch for good break in the exchange. And if the discussion is really good and accomplishing something - then toss out the time boxing.
