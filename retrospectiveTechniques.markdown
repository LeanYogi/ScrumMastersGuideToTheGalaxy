#Retrospective techniques
There probably hundreds of retrospective techniques on the web to try. Some geared to improving, some to team building, etc..

One thing to remember is want mix it up, otherwise retros will become stale if use the same method each time...
For most want try get 1 or 2 actionable goals that team can work on in the next sprint. But make sure keep it to just 1 or 2, since if take more it unlikely they will be completed or met in next sprint.
